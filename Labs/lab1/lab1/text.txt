There are four types of schools in the English and Welsh education system — nursery. "Primary, 
secondary and private schools. Scotland has its own education system, which is different."
Children start school at the age of five, but there is some free nursery-school education before 
that age. "The state nursery schools are not for all. They are for some families, for example for 
families with only one parent. In most areas there are private nursery schools." Parents who want 
their children to go to nursery school pay for their children under 5 years old to go to these 
private nursery schools.
